# Digit-Recognition-Java
This project is to program a machine learning system to categorise one of the UCI digit tasks. The program is going to read from two CSV files. The input data is going to be a matrix of 8x8, where each element is between 0 and 16. Neural networks and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were used in this project.
